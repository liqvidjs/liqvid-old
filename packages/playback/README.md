# @liqvid/playback

This package provides the `Playback` class, which is effectively an animation loop + event emitter pretending to be an HTML media element advancing in time. This is the "engine" at the heart of [Liqvid](https://liqvidjs.org). See https://liqvidjs.org/docs/reference/Playback for documentation.
